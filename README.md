# birdCollector

I'm a nature lover and one of the things I enjoy doing is sitting in my backyard and watching the birds that come visit. I've seen several different kinds, but I know there's a lot more out there!  I created this full-CRUD  Bird Collector app as a way to keep track of all the different birds i've seen.  The user has the ability to add birds to the database, and, once the user has seen the bird in real life, they can 'add' this bird to their collection.

Technologies used:  EJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Heroku

How to use the app:

- The main page contains a database of birds, with their names and blurred out phots.
- The user may click on the photo to reach the show page, which will contain an enlarged photo, as well as more details about the bird.
- In the show page is an edit button.  Clicking on the edit button takes you to a screen with a checkbox that will allow you to add the bird to your         collection, as well as add some notes about the bird.  
- Once a bird is added to a collection, the displayed on the main page changes so that the bird photo is no longer blurry, as well as the word 'spotted!'     appears below the bird name
- The My Collection page can be accessed from the main page, as well as the show page.  The My Collection page contains all the birds that the user has       already spotted.

Future Enhancements:
1. the ability to upload more photos of a bird
2. either a link or an embedded sound player for the bird calls
